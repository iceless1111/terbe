# Terbe
A simple Python Package makes you code faster

Here's some example to show whats terbe

`python3 example.py arg1 arg2`

is same to

`python3 -c import terbe;terbe.coding.SandBox(["example.py", "arg1", "arg2"])`

It means you can just use terbe.coding.SandBox to run a .py file without accessing system command
